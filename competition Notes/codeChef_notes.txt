          --> key point

Most questions are hidden pattern type questions , rather than developing theory and
seeing the pattern , do test cases on it , and see the pattern  

1. STRNO
--> key Points: 
        1.find prime factorization of a number fast by using square root technique
        2. find if a number is prime or not ..fastly ..by using square root technique
        3.core logic : Every number greater than or equal to 2 , can be written as product of prime numbers

2.UNITGCD
--> 1. n and (n+1) are always co prime 
    2. no two even numbers can be co prime (trivial)
